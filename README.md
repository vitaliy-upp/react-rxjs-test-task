# react-rxjs-test-task

EXERCISE:
A live analytics dashboard displays data about a medical operating room to doctors and nurses. It receives its data from three independent monitoring systems:

Temperature

Air pressure

Humidity
Each system sends randomly data every 100-2000ms.
TASK:

Write an observable that, when subscribed to, emits a "display object" containing the latest value of all three systems, to be consumed by the dashboard.
REQUIREMENTS:

Display object should not be emitted more often than every 100ms

Display object should only be emitted when one of the systems sends a new value

If a value is not received from a specific system for more than 1000ms, its reading (in the display object) should be 'N/A'

All 3 systems must emit at least one value before 1 display object is ever sent to the dashboard.
For the purposes of this exercise, assume that the readings from each system are available as a 'data' event on a node EventEmitter. For example:

temperature = new EventEmitter();

temperature.on('data', data => { // data = '24.2' })
DELIVERABLES:

provide a basic UI in react

all your RX business logic must be inside a UNIQUE observable

provide unit tests and basic component tests

share a github repo with your code

this coding exercise can be completed in 2-3 hours.
Nota Bene:

you do not need to implement a backend. You can emulate the random data straight inside you React application by using an EventEmitter or other RXJS syntax.

this exercise is about RXJS; you need to use it.
